1. Explain about class and objects
CLASS:
Class is a blueprint or plan for object.It defines properties (variables) and behaviors (methods).
Example:
If “Car” is a class ->color, model, speed are properties .
                      drive(), brake() are behaviors
class is declard using class keyword.

OBJECT:
Object is a real time entity that created from the class.it represents state(data) and behavior(methods).
it is used to access class variables and methods.
Example:
* Car is a class--> "white adi car" is an object.
* Animal is a class-->dog,cat is an object.
Objects are created using new keword and a constructor
ex: classname objname = new classname();



2. Create a program as  follows:

      Parent Class: Person who can walk,run,sit and has attributes height,weight
      Child Class: Student who has own method study and also can inherit the methods and properties from Person
     Print the results.

class Person{    //parent class
	void walk (){
		System.out.println(" person is walking");
	}
	void run(){
		System.out.println("person is running");
		
	}
	void sit() {
		System.out.println("person is sitting");
	}
	// properties
	int height;
	int weight;
	
		}

public class Student  extends Person{  //child class
	
	void study() {
		System.out.println("student is studying");
	}
public static void main(String[] args) {
	Student child=new Student();
	child.walk();
	child.sit();
	child.run();
	child.study();
	child.height=160;
	System.out.println("height:" +child.height);
	child.weight=60;
	System.out.println("weight:"+ child.weight);
	
	}
}
