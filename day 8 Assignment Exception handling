1. What is the difference between Error and Exception? Explain with examples.
Error:
Definition :A serious problem that the application cannot handle.
Caused By: Mostly system-level problems (like JVM failure, memory overflow).
Recoverable: Usually not recoverable.
Checked/Unchecked: Always unchecked
Handling: Cannot be handled by try-catch
For Example:OutOfMemoryError, StackOverflowError


Exception:
Definition: An abnormal condition that the application can handle using code.
Caused By: Mostly programming mistakes or external conditions (like invalid input, file not found).
Recoverable: Usually recoverable by handling.
Checked/Unchecked: Can be checked (must handle) or unchecked (may choose to handle).
Handling: Can be handled by try-catch blocks.
EXAMPLE: ArithmeticException, NullPointerException

2. Write a program for handling exception
public class Exceptionhandle{

	public static void main(String[] args) {
	
		try {
		int[]array= {1,2,3,4};
		System.out.println(array[4]);
		} catch(ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException a) {
			System.out.println("**array exception handled**");
		}
		
		
		try {
		String name= null;
		System.out.println(name.length());
		}catch(NullPointerException n) {
			n.printStackTrace();
		}
		System.out.println("*nullpointer exception handled*");
		
		System.out.println(" --type next-- ");
	
	}
}
